# park-brew

## Description

We are designing a web application that uses APIâ€™s to help users locate National Parks within a given state, as well as Breweries in a designated city. This will help park goers to find a nice place to unwind after a long day at the park.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
The user inputs a city and state into our search bars and a list of breweries and National Parks will populate. The user can click on the names to visit the website for the breweries and parks and click the save icon to store results in client side storage if they want to visit them.
